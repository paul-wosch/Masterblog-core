## ⚠️ Disclaimer  
This project was created as part of my learning journey during a multi‑month software engineering course. It should be viewed as such: a work in progress where I applied my best effort and current knowledge. The focus of this project was on **Object‑Oriented Programming (OOP)**, **Flask**, **Jinja2 templates**, and **Python packaging**. While not production‑ready, it reflects my growth and dedication to learning software engineering principles.

## 📝 Description  
**Masterblog** is a simple blogging application built with Flask. It allows users to create, view, update, delete, and like blog posts. Posts are stored in JSON files with auto‑incrementing IDs, simulating database‑like persistence without requiring a database server.  

The project demonstrates:  
- Clean separation of concerns (models, storage, app, templates).  
- Use of Flask with Jinja2 templates and CSS styling.  
- JSON‑based persistence with sequence tracking for IDs.  
- OOP design with `Blog` and `Post` classes.  
- A progression from backend foundations to a functional web UI (as seen in the commit history).

## 🛠️ Development Setup  

Go to your project’s working directory:  

1. **Clone the repository**:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/paul-wosch/Masterblog.git
   cd Masterblog
   ```

2. **Create virtual environment** (optional):  
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   ```

3. **Activate virtual environment** (optional):  
   ```bash
   source .venv/bin/activate   # Mac/Linux
   .venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows
   ```

4. **Install local package**:  
   ```bash
   pip install -e .
   ```

5. **Run the app**:  
   ```bash
   python src/myapp/app.py
   ```

6. **Deactivate virtual environment** (optional):  
   ```bash
   deactivate
   ```

The `pip install -e .` makes `myapp` importable, ensuring `app.py` can resolve imports correctly.
